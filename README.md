# Multi-Step Form — Frontend Mentor

Project developed as a Frontend Mentor challenge.
The goal is to build a complete multi-step form using modern frontend tools such as React, TypeScript, Context API, DTOs, SCSS, and Cypress for automated end-to-end testing.

This project demonstrates clean architecture, reusable components, global state management, validation handling, and a fully responsive layout.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React + TypeScript (Create React App)**
- **Context API (useContext)** — to store and share state across all steps
- **DTO (Data Transfer Object)** — to organize the project’s data structure and types
- **Sass (SCSS)** — for modular and responsive styling
- **react-hook-form** — for fast and efficient form validation
  **Zod** — schema validation for form fields
- **Cypress** — end-to-end interface testing
- **Basic SEO** — essential metadata for the website
- **js-confetti** — used for the final success animation

## 📦 About the Project

The goal of this challenge is to build a multi-step form where users can enter personal information, choose a plan, select add-ons, and review the summary before confirmation.  
The app maintains state across steps, validates input, and offers a smooth and intuitive user flow.
